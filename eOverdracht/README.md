# eOverdracht workshop

## Description

This workshop depends on the *Network in a day* workshop.
Make sure you completed that one before starting this one.

In this workshop you'll learn how to:

- register specific services required for the eOverdracht;
- create and validate an access token;
- send eOverdracht notifications;
- retrieve FHIR resources;
- make use of authorization credentials;
- add user authentication;

The code blocks will either show a shell/terminal command or a http request.
Most code samples/shell commands are specific for the eOverdracht bolt. 

There are two roles within the eOverdracht bolt: the sender and receiver (sometimes called placer and filler).
Implementing both roles a quite a lot of work. Given the time available in the workshop, it's better to choose one of the roles.
The rest of this workshop manual is divided in these 2 roles.
